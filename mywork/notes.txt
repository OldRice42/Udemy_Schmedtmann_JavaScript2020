...***Code Editors***...

VS Code is one of the most widely used Editors
Other editors include Atom and Brackets
This course uses VS Code. It works on every platform.

Settings used:
-Color Theme - Monikai Pro (My personal preferred is Gloom Dark)
-Files: Auto Save - onFocuseChange
-Editor: Multi Cursor Modifier - ctrlCmd
-Editor: Formato on Save - Yes (this will be used by a formator we will be installing later)
-Icon Theme - Minimal (Visual Stuido Code) (My personal preferred is Material Icon Theme)

================================

...***The Browser's Console***...

-The console can be opened in a web browser to test JS commands. To try a Hello World, open the console and enter
  alert("Hello World!")
then press Enter. A pop up should appear with Hello World in it.
-The console can hold variables. Try this one out:
  let js = 'amazing'
  if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is FUN!')
This should return a prompt with JavaScript is FUN!
  js = 'boring'
  if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is FUN!')
This should not return anything, because we changed the variable for js from 'amazing' to 'boring'.
-You can reuse previous commands by pressing the up key.
-The console can also be used as a calculator.
  40+8+23-10
This should return 61 in the console

...***Fundimentals Part 1***...

"JavaScript is a high-level (we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management), object-oriented )based on objects, for storing most kinds of data), multi-paradigm (we can use differnent styles of programming) programming language (instruct the computer to do things)."

3 core techs in WebDev
